# imshow

A command line tool to display images in the terminal.

The terminal must support ANSI RGB sequences.

## TODO
* Handle terminal cell size better (about twice as high as wide)
* Introduce property-based tests where appropriate (lengths, normalized\_by\_sum)
* Take alpha channel into account

## Trivia

The name is a reference to Matlab's imshow, which I know through matplotlib's (Python) imshow.
