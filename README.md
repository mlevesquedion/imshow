# imshow

A command line tool to display images in the terminal.

The terminal must support RGB ANSI sequences.

## TODO
* Add option to constrain display by height as well as width
* Take alpha channel into account
* chunking: take crops instead of referencing each pixel separately?
* chunks\_up\_to: loop up to max\_value instead of creating an intermediate vector?
* chunks: use itertools?
