# imshow

A command line tool to display images in the terminal.

The terminal must support RGB ANSI sequences.

## TODO
* Investigate weird dark vertical line artifacts (low weights?)
* Take alpha channel into account

## Trivia

The name is a reference to Matlab's imshow, which I know through matplotlib's (Python) imshow.
